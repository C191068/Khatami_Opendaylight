-y: This option automatically confirms (yes) to any prompts or questions during the installation process. It's used to avoid manual confirmation.

install: This is the subcommand that tells "apt-get" to install the specified software packages.

unzip vim wget: These are the names of the software packages you want to install. In this case, you're installing the "unzip," "vim," and "wget" packages.

Vim is a powerful text editor that is available on most Linux and Unix systems. It is known for its efficiency and flexibility, but it can also be difficult to learn at first.

One of the most important things to understand about Vim is that it has two modes: command mode and insert mode. In command mode, you can use keyboard shortcuts to move around the document, delete text, and perform other operations. In insert mode, you can type text into the document.

openjdk-8-jre: This is the name of the package you want to install. In this case, you're installing the OpenJDK 8 Java Runtime Environment, which is necessary for running Java applications.

update-alternatives: This is a Debian-specific command for managing symbolic links used to choose default system-wide software versions. In this case, you're using it to manage the Java executable.

--config java: This part of the command specifies that you want to configure the "java" alternative. It means you're dealing with the Java runtime environment.

JAVA_HOME" is an environment variable used to specify the location of the Java Development Kit (JDK) or Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on your computer. It's often used by various Java applications and development tools to know where Java is installed. When you set the "JAVA_HOME" variable, you're telling your system where to find Java.

.bashrc is a configuration file for the Bash shell, which is the default command-line shell in many Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. The file is typically located in your home directory and is executed every time you open a new terminal session. It allows you to customize the behavior of your shell environment by defining variables, setting paths, and running scripts.

In the context of the command you provided, you are adding a line to your .bashrc file that sets the "JAVA_HOME" environment variable. This can be useful because many Java-related applications and development environments rely on this variable to find the Java installation and execute Java code properly. By setting "JAVA_HOME" in your .bashrc, you ensure that it's available whenever you open a new terminal session, making it easier to work with Java-related tools and applications.

 The command "sudo apt-get update" is used in Debian-based Linux distributions like Ubuntu to update the package repository information. Let's break down each part of the command:

sudo: This is a command that allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy. It's often used to run commands with administrative privileges.

apt-get: This is the package management command-line tool in Debian-based Linux distributions. It is used for handling packages, including installing, updating, upgrading, and removing them.

update: This is the specific subcommand of "apt-get." When you run "apt-get update," it instructs the package manager to update the local database of available packages and their versions from the repositories specified in the system's package sources.

So, when you run "sudo apt-get update," you are telling the system to refresh its knowledge about the software packages available in the repositories, which is essential before installing or upgrading software to ensure you have the most up-to-date package information.































Here are some possible reasons why OpenDaylight is not running at http://127.0.0.1:8181/index.html after you stopped ONOS:

Port conflict: ONOS may be still using port 8181. Check the ONOS logs to see if it is still running. If it is, stop ONOS and then try to start OpenDaylight again.
Permissions issue: The OpenDaylight user may not have permission to access port 8181. Try running the OpenDaylight startup script as root.
OpenDaylight is not running: Make sure that the OpenDaylight process is running. You can check this by running the following command:
ps aux | grep opendaylight
If you see the OpenDaylight process in the output, then it is running. If you do not see the OpenDaylight process, then try starting it again.

OpenDaylight is not configured: Make sure that OpenDaylight is configured to listen on port 8181. You can check the OpenDaylight configuration file (opendaylight-configuration.xml) to verify this.
Here are some steps you can try to troubleshoot the issue:

Stop ONOS: Make sure that ONOS is stopped. You can check this by running the following command:
ps aux | grep onos
If you see the ONOS process in the output, then stop it using the ONOS stop script.

Check port 8181: Use the following command to check if port 8181 is in use:
netstat -ano | grep 8181
If the output shows that port 8181 is in use by another process, stop that process.

Start OpenDaylight: Start OpenDaylight using the startup script. If you are running the OpenDaylight delux distribution, you can use the following command to start it:
./opendaylight.sh start
Check the OpenDaylight logs: If OpenDaylight is still not running, check the OpenDaylight logs for any errors. The OpenDaylight logs can be found in the following directory:
/var/log/opendaylight
Restart OpenDaylight: If you are still unable to start OpenDaylight, try restarting your server.
If you are still having trouble starting OpenDaylight, please post a question on the OpenDaylight community forum.
